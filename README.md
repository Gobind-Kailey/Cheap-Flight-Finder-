# Cheap-Flight-Finder-
In this project I used the 'Sheety' API for retrieving the Google Sheet data, The Amadeous API for finding the flights, and Twilio API for messaging cheap flights. I also used OOP as there are 6 of files of code and it makes it easier to catch mistakes and create distinctions. I also used environment variables for safety.
